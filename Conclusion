## Business Problem

Customer churn poses a major revenue-threat for subscription/telecom businesses — losing customers often costs much more than acquiring new ones. This project aims to analyze churn patterns and highlight the regions and customer segments most at risk.

## Analytical Approach

Used a publicly available telecom churn dataset (~7K records) to identify churn drivers. 
GitHub

Performed data cleaning and transformation in SQL Server: replaced nulls, standardized data types, created optimized tables for churn analysis. 
GitHub

Created a dynamic dashboard in Power BI that visualizes KPIs: total customers, new joiners, churn count, churn rate, and regional breakdowns. 
GitHub

Built custom DAX measures and applied Power Query transformations to enable filter-by-region, customer type, and tenure.

## Key Insights

A region (Jammu & Kashmir) exhibited the highest churn rate, indicating location-specific risk. 
GitHub

Other states showed churn remaining fairly stable even after segmentation, suggesting potential service or operational issues specific to high-churn regions.
