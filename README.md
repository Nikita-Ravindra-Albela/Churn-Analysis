# Churn-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn patterns using excel, SQL Server &amp; Power BI to help businesses understand why customers leave and which regions are most affected. The goal is to identify trends, measure churn rates, and uncover actionable insights that can improve customer retention strategies.

🎯 Objective

To analyze and visualize customer churn patterns using an interactive dashboard, providing a clear view of total customers, new joiners, churn counts, and churn rates across different regions.

🗂️ Dataset Source

Dataset: Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)

Type: Public telecom customer dataset

Size: ~7,000 records with customer details such as demographics, contract type, tenure, and revenue data.

🧮 Data Preparation

Data cleaning and transformation were performed in SQL Server before connecting to Power BI.
Key preprocessing steps:

Checked for null values and replaced them with relevant substitute values.

Created a new SQL table optimized for churn analysis.

Ensured column consistency and correct data types for Power BI integration.

📊 Dashboard Metrics and KPIs

The Power BI dashboard includes the following visuals and indicators:

Total Customers – overall active customers in the dataset

New Joiners – customers acquired within the selected period

Total Churn – total customers lost (churned)

Churn Rate (%) – percentage of churned customers vs total customers

Geographical Breakdown – churn rate comparison across different states

All KPIs are dynamically filterable by region, customer type, and tenure.

💡 Key Insights

Highest churn rate observed in Jammu & Kashmir.

For other states, churn levels remain relatively stable, showing no major variation even after applying filters.

Indicates that customer loss is regionally concentrated rather than widespread.

Suggests an opportunity to investigate service quality or regional factors specific to high-churn areas.
